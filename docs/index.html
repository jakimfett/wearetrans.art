                <p>Probably the most affirming thing was hearing the term <q>gender euphoria</q> and realizing how well it described so many of my experiences.</p>
                <p>It's wasn't so much about being correctly gendered by others, it was mostly me being so very happy because I was giving myself space to exist.</p>

                <p>Three girls on a trampoline, just messin' around<br>
                    One is younger and one is older, the other is a boy</p>
                <p>Now they jump high in the air, not a care at all<br>
                    We just are who we are, nobody can take that away</p>
                <p>As the years go on, and the girls drift apart<br>
                    One is younger and one is older, the other is a man</p>
                <p>Now I wonder, do they remember who I am<br>
                    We are not are who we were, time has taken that away</p>
                <p>As the years go on, they come back together<br>
                    One is younger and one is older, the other is a woman</p>
                <p>Now we all know, there were three girls on a trampoline</p>
